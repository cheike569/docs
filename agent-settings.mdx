## Agents

Each agent in Greetmate is a separate entity that can be configured to handle different types of calls. You can create multiple agents to handle different types of calls, such as sales, support, or billing.

### Edit an agent
1. Go to the [Agent Overview](https://www.greetmate.ai/bot/settings)
2. Click Edit

You can find your bot's extension number in the dashboard. This number is unique to your bot and can be used to make calls. Upon calling the generic number you'll have to enter the extension number to reach your bot.
