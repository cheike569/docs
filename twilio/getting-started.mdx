### When to use a custom Twilio account
<Note>
It is not mandatory to use a custom Twilio account. You can use Greetmate without a custom Twilio account if you don't do any texting and if you don't need to register a 10DLC number or use different country codes.
</Note>

You can, for example, connect your own Twilio account if you have existing numbers, 10 DLC registrations or if you want to use your own Twilio account for compliance reasons. You can also use your own Twilio account if you want to use Greetmate in a country where we do not have a local Twilio account.
